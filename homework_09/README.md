# Homework: Module 9 - Web-scraping

## Task

Choose the BeautifulSoup library or the Scrapy framework. You need to scrape http://quotes.toscrape.com. Your goal is to get two files: qoutes.json, where you will put all information about quotes from all pages of the site, and authors.json, where you will find information about the authors of said quotes. The structure of the json files should be exactly the same as in the previous homework. Run the previously written scripts to upload the json files to the cloud database for the received files. The previous homework should work correctly with the newly acquired database.

## Additional Task

Use the Scrapy framework for scraping. Starting the crawler should be done in the form of a single main.py script.
